# hello-world

I am finally starting my GitHub account to collaborate, learn, and practice coding with other like minded individuals in the community.
I am currently in college pursuing a degree in Informations Systems Technology, specializing in computer programming.
So far all I have coded in is Java, shortly my classes are going to be leading into Python.
